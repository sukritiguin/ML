# k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and intuitive machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks.

## Steps Followed in KNN Algorithm

1. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect and prepare your dataset, ensuring that it includes labeled data points.
   - Normalize or standardize the features to ensure that they are on similar scales. This step is essential to prevent features with larger ranges from dominating the distance calculation.

2. **Choose the Value of k**:
   - Decide the number of neighbors (k) to consider when making predictions. This is a hyperparameter that you need to tune based on your specific problem and dataset.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - For each new data point (the one you want to make a prediction for), calculate the distance between that data point and all other data points in the training set. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and others, depending on the nature of your data.

4. **Neighbor Selection**:
   - Select the k training data points (neighbors) that have the smallest distances to the new data point.

5. **Majority Voting (Classification)**:
   - If you are using KNN for classification, count the occurrences of each class among the k neighbors.
   - Assign the class with the highest count as the predicted class for the new data point.

6. **Average (or Weighted Average) Calculation (Regression)**:
   - If you are using KNN for regression, calculate the average (or weighted average) of the target values of the k neighbors.
   - Assign this average as the predicted value for the new data point.

7. **Prediction**:
   - For classification tasks, the prediction is the class label with the highest count among the neighbors.
   - For regression tasks, the prediction is the calculated average (or weighted average).

8. **Evaluate and Tune**:
   - Measure the performance of your KNN model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, or Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression.
   - You can perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal value of k and assess the overall performance of your model.

9. **Predict New Data**:
   - Once your KNN model is trained and tuned, you can use it to make predictions for new, unseen data points by following the same steps: calculating distances, selecting neighbors, and making predictions.

**Note**: KNN is a relatively simple algorithm and can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. Additionally, the choice of distance metric, value of k, and data preprocessing techniques can significantly influence the algorithm's performance.
